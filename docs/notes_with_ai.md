title: Crafting Highly-Specific, Contextually-Accurate Notes from Engineering Meetings
---
### Introduction
Technical writers attend many meetings throughout the week. 

It can be challenging to keep track of all of the relevant information a writer would need to craft high-quality work when these meetings pile up; important details can be lost. By utilizing an AI-augmented workflow, I can extract every meaningful detail from an engineering standup to better understand how to serve the documentation needs of the team and create more accurate documentation deliverables.

In this example, I show my process for gathering relevant information from an engineering meeting to create notes to be used for documentation projects.

### Sample Meeting

### Process

#### Recording and Transcribing

I begin by recording the meeting using an application like Google Meet. 

Then, I take the recorded meeting and extract a transcript which I load into an AI in PDF format. To start the prompting process, I first establish role and context:
